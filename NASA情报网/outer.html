                12 features on Asteroid Bennu, the subject of NASA’s first mission to bring an asteroid sample back to
                Earth, have been given official names. Bennu’s own name was inspired by an ancient Egyptian deity,
                depicted
                as a bird, that was associated with the Sun, creation and rebirth. In keeping with this theme, the
                features
                have been given names related to mythological birds and bird-like creatures.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Asteroid Bennu’s most prominent boulder, a rock chunk jutting out 21.7 metres from the asteroid’s
                southern
                hemisphere — so large that it was initially detected from Earth — has been officially designated Benben
                Saxum, after the primordial hill that first arose from the dark waters in an ancient Egyptian creation
                myth.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Benben Saxum and 11 other features are the first on the roughly 500 metre-wide asteroid to receive
                official
                Bennu feature names approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the internationally
                recognised
                authority for naming celestial bodies and their surface features. The accepted names were proposed by
                NASA’s
                OSIRIS-REx team members, who have been mapping the asteroid in detail over the last year. The OSIRIS-REx
                spacecraft is currently orbiting the asteroid and is scheduled to collect a sample from Bennu’s surface
                this
                summer.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                “Since arriving at the asteroid, the OSIRIS-REx team has become incredibly familiar with all of the
                geological features on Bennu,” said Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx principal investigator at the University
                of
                Arizona, Tucson. “These features are providing us with insight into Bennu’s history, and their new names
                symbolise the essence of the mission — studying the past to both discover our origins and understand our
                future.”
            </p><br />
            <p>
                The approved Bennu surface feature names are listed below. Bennu’s diverse terrains — including regiones
                (broad geographic regions), craters, dorsa (ridges), fossae (grooves or trenches) and saxa (rocks and
                boulders) — will be named after birds and bird-like creatures in mythology, and the places associated
                with
                them.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Tlanuwa Regio is named for the giant birds who scattered the Earth with pieces of a serpent that turned
                into
                standing pillars of rocks in Cherokee mythology. Tlanuwa Regio is an area covered by large boulders in
                Bennu’s southern hemisphere.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Benben Saxum is named for an ancient Egyptian mound that arose from the primordial waters Nu. In
                Egyptian
                mythology, the god Atum settled upon Benben to create the world after his flight over the waters in the
                form
                of the Bennu bird. Benben Saxum is the tallest boulder on Bennu.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Roc Saxum is named for the Roc, an enormous bird of prey in Arabian mythology of the Middle East. Roc
                Saxum
                is the largest boulder feature on Bennu.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Simurgh Saxum is named for the benevolent, mythological bird in Persian mythology that was said to
                possess
                all knowledge. Simurgh Saxum defines the prime meridian on Bennu and is the basis for the asteroid’s
                coordinate system.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Huginn Saxum and Muninn Saxum are adjacent boulders named for the two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who
                accompany the god Odin in Norse mythology.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Ocypete Saxum is named for one of the Greek harpies, the half-maiden and half-bird personification of
                storm
                winds that would snatch and carry things away from Earth. Ocypete Saxum is located near the origin of
                the
                particle ejection event of 19 January 2019 on Bennu.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Strix Saxum is named for the Strix bird of ill-omen from Roman mythology. Strix Saxum is a large boulder
                flanking the OSIRIS-REx mission’s backup sample collection site.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Amihan Saxum is named for the Tagalog (Philippines) deity, who is depicted as a bird and was the first
                creature to inhabit the Universe in Tagalog mythology. This large, flat boulder appears to be partly
                buried
                and is located in Tlanuwa Regio, which has an unusually high concentration of large boulders.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Pouakai Saxum is named for the monstrous bird who kills and eats humans in Māori (Polynesia) mythology.
                Pouakai Saxum is a 10.6 metre-wide boulder located in Bennu’s southern hemisphere, slightly north of
                Benben
                Saxum.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Aetos Saxum is named for the childhood playmate of the supreme god Zeus, who was turned into an eagle by
                Hera in Greek mythology. Aetos Saxum is a conspicuously flat boulder, with a general wing-like shape
                located
                near Bennu’s equator.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Gargoyle Saxum is named for the French dragon-like monster with wings, a bird-like neck, and the ability
                to
                breathe fire. Gargoyle Saxum is a large prominent boulder near the mission’s backup sample site, and is
                one
                of the darkest objects on the surface.
